# GetHired

An interactive repository to learn, visualize, and understand Time Complexity, Space Complexity, and Flow Diagrams for common algorithms.
This project presents algorithms in an intuitive and exploratory manner using interactive elements like collapsible sections, links, animations, and diagrams.

## Features

✔️ Interactive algorithm explanations
✔️ Time & Space Complexity breakdowns
✔️ Flow diagrams (draw.io / mermaid)
✔️ Collapsible sections for clean reading
✔️ Beginner-friendly examples
✔️ Organized by algorithm category
